<h3>Things To Consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>The game is totally made in C++ and Open GL</li>
<li>The game is still under development and hence it might need alot of performance optimizations as well as some visual effects to add a look and a feel to the game</li>
<li>The levels are so boring and they look the same except for the big boss level which comes after every 10 levels</li>
<li>Text Rendering is not yet supported so i use textures mainly for rendering any text on the screen</li>
<li>No audio support yet</li>
</ul>
